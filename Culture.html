<b>1. Nepalese Tradition</b>
<p>The Nepalese tradition is a bright mix of its ethnicity and religion; every culture has its significance. The Nepalese greet each other by joining two of their hands and slightly bowing down; this is called a Namaste. 
<img src="images/22.jpg" style="float: right; width: 400px; height: 250px;">
Along with the Namaste comes warm greeting to guests who are regarded as gods and are treated with great respect. According to the Nepalese culture, life is a gift, and every person is to be considered as a god, so every event in life must be cherished. Even when a child is born, the name-giving ceremony is called Nuwaran, where the child is given name starting from an auspicious starting letter. Later, when the child becomes 5-6 months old, the first time he/she eats rice is celebrated as Pasni with a feast.<br>
If the child is a boy, then he undergoes a ceremony call Bratabandha which declares him as a man. The boys shave their head during this ritual. In the Newari community, girls marry a wood apple during their adolescence to shelter her if her husband dies as the wood apple is a symbol for Lord Kumar. The Newari girls also go through the Bara ceremony or also known as 'Gufa rakhne' as a symbol of ascension to womanhood. The marriage ceremonies are treated auspiciously too, with a very elaborate ritual, including the bride and the groom.</p><br>

<b>2. Ethnicity</b>
<p>Different Ethnicity in Nepal
The ethnicity is based on the diverse geography of the country. In general, the ethnic groups of Nepal can be divided into three types: Indigenous Nepalese, Indo-Nepalese and Tibeto-Nepalese.<img src="images/23.jpg" style="float: right; width: 360px; height: 220px;"> The Tibeto-Nepalese are said to have migrated from Tibet and settled in the mountainous regions of Nepal. Their culture is similar to that of Tibetan society, and they have a Mongoloid appearance. They are said to wear Bakkhu and Docha, which are thick clothes suited for cold weather. The indigenous Nepalese include those who existed in Nepal before the arrival of the other ethnic groups. Their culture is deeply rooted in traditional Nepalese ways. They mostly reside in the hilly regions of the country. The indigenous people makeup about 35.81% of the total population of Nepal and very diverse within themselves too.<br>Lastly, the Indo-Nepalese, who migrated from India reside in the Hilly and Terai regions of the Nation. These include the fertile lands, and thus their primary occupation during the ancient times was farming. The Indian ways mostly influence Their culture, and the Indo-Nepalese have an Aryan complexion. They compose the majority of Nepal's population, and their reach can be found in almost all regions of Nepal.</p><br>

Since ancient times Hinduism is established as the dominant religion in the Nation. It was previously a Hindu Nation, and 81.3% of the total population of Nepal are Hindus.  Hinduism largely influences the culture and tradition of Nepal due to the sheer number of followers of Hinduism. The second most dominant religion would be Buddhism, with 9% of the total population. The rest of the community follows Islam (4.4%), Kiratism (3%), Christianity (1.5%) and others (0.6%).<br>
The perfect harmony among the followers of various religions is truly a wonder. Many Buddhist and Hindu religious sites are interconnected or combined. The followers of both religion equally respect the deities and worship them. This is an example of the harmony and feeling of brotherhood that exists in the Nepalese culture.</p><br>
